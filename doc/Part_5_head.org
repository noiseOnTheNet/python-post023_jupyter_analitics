We made quite a journey so far! Starting from [[https://noiseonthenet.space/noise/2025/01/a-trip-to-jupyter-lab/][Jupyter]] and [[https://noiseonthenet.space/noise/2025/01/meet-the-pandas/][Pandas]] we [[https://noiseonthenet.space/noise/2025/02/data-the-final-frontier/][explored our
datasets]] and [[https://noiseonthenet.space/noise/2025/02/coming-back-down-to-earth/][created independent scripts]].

It is now the time to learn the basics of a very powerful tool: Linear Regression.

Linearity is a key concept in mathematics: it goes very far from the naive idea
of a straight line into more abstract concepts like the independence of two
effecs into a dynamic system.

The jupyter notebooks for this series of posts, the datasets, their source and
their attribution are available in this [[https://github.com/noiseOnTheNet/python-post023_jupyter_analitics][Github Repo]]
